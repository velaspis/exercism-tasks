Introduction
Numbers
Many programming languages have specific numeric types to represent different types of numbers, but JavaScript only has two:

number: a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754). Examples are -6, -2.4, 0, 0.1, 1, 3.14, 16.984025, 25, 976, 1024.0 and 500000.
bigint: a numeric data type that can represent integers in the arbitrary precision format. Examples are -12n, 0n, 4n, and 9007199254740991n.
If you require arbitrary precision or work with extremely large numbers, use the bigint type. Otherwise, the number type is likely the better option.

Rounding
There is a built-in global object called Math that provides various rounding functions. For example, you can round down (floor) or round up (ceil) decimal numbers to the nearest whole numbers.

Math.floor(234.34); // => 234
Math.ceil(234.34); // => 235
Arithmetic Operators
JavaScript provides 6 different operators to perform basic arithmetic operations on numbers.

+: The addition operator is used to find the sum of numbers.
-: The subtraction operator is used to find the difference between two numbers
*: The multiplication operator is used to find the product of two numbers.
/: The division operator is used to divide two numbers.
2 - 1.5; //=> 0.5
19 / 2; //=> 9.5
%: The remainder operator is used to find the remainder of a division performed.

40 % 4; // => 0
-11 % 4; // => -3
**: The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power.

4 ** 3; // => 64
4 ** 1 / 2; // => 2
Order of Operations
When using multiple operators in a line, JavaScript follows an order of precedence as shown in this precedence table. To simplify it to our context, JavaScript uses the PEDMAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) rule we've learnt in elementary math classes.

const result = 3 ** 3 + 9 * 4 / (3 - 1);
// => 3 ** 3 + 9 * 4/2
// => 27 + 9 * 4/2
// => 27 + 18
// => 45
Shorthand Assignment Operators
Shorthand assignment operators are a shorter way of writing code conducting arithmetic operations on a variable, and assigning the new value to the same variable. For example, consider two variables x and y. Then, x += y is same as x = x + y. Often, this is used with a number instead of a variable y. The 5 other operations can also be conducted in a similar style.

let x = 5;
x += 25; // x is now 30

let y = 31;
y %= 3; // y is now 1
Instructions
In this exercise you will be writing code to help a freelancer communicate with their clients about the prices of certain projects. You will write a few utility functions to quickly calculate the costs for the clients.

Task 1
Calculate the day rate given an hourly rate

A client contacts the freelancer to enquire about their rates. The freelancer explains that they work 8 hours a day. However, the freelancer knows only their hourly rates for the project. Help them estimate a day rate given an hourly rate.

dayRate(89);
// => 712
The day rate does not need to be rounded or changed to a "fixed" precision.

Task 3
Calculate the discounted rate for large projects

How to debug
When a test fails, a message is displayed describing what went wrong and for which input. You can also use the fact that any console output will be shown too. You can write to the console using:

console.log('Debug message');
