Introduction
JavaScript is a dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

(Re-)Assignment
There are a few primary ways to assign values to names in JavaScript - using variables or constants. On Exercism, variables are always written in camelCase; constants are written in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. There is no official guide to follow, and various companies and organizations have various style guides. Feel free to write variables any way you like. The upside from writing them the way the exercises are prepared is that they'll be highlighted differently in the web interface and most IDEs.

Variables in JavaScript can be defined using the const, let or var keyword.

A variable can reference different values over its lifetime when using let or var. For example, myFirstVariable can be defined and redefined many times using the assignment operator =:

let myFirstVariable = 1;
myFirstVariable = 'Some string';
myFirstVariable = new SomeComplexClass();
In contrast to let and var, variables that are defined with const can only be assigned once. This is used to define constants in JavaScript.

const MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 10;

// Can not be re-assigned.
MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 20;
// => TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
ðŸ’¡ In a later Concept Exercise the difference between constant assignment / binding and constant value is explored and explained.

Function Declarations
In JavaScript, units of functionality are encapsulated in functions, usually grouping functions together in the same file if they belong together. These functions can take parameters (arguments), and can return a value using the return keyword. Functions are invoked using () syntax.

function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

add(1, 3);
// => 4
ðŸ’¡ In JavaScript there are many different ways to declare a function. These other ways look different than using the function keyword. The track tries to gradually introduce them, but if you already know about them, feel free to use any of them. In most cases, using one or the other isn't better or worse.

Exposing to Other Files
To make a function, a constant, or a variable available in other files, they need to be exported using the export keyword. Another file may then import these using the import keyword. This is also known as the module system. A great example is how all the tests work. Each exercise has at least one file, for example lasagna.js, which contains the implementation. Additionally there is at least one other file, for example lasagna.spec.js, that contains the tests. This file imports the public (i.e. exported) entities in order to test the implementation:

// file.js
export const MY_VALUE = 10;

export function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// file.spec.js
import { MY_VALUE, add } from './file';

add(MY_VALUE, 5);
// => 15
Instructions
Lucian's girlfriend is on her way home, and he hasn't cooked their anniversary dinner!

In this exercise, you're going to write some code to help Lucian cook an exquisite lasagna from his favorite cookbook.

You have four tasks related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

Task 1
Define the expected oven time in minutes

Define the EXPECTED_MINUTES_IN_OVEN constant that represents how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven. It must be exported. According to the cooking book, the expected oven time in minutes is 40.

Task 2
Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

Task 3
Calculate the preparation time in minutes

Task 4
Calculate the total working time in minutes

How to debug
When a test fails, a message is displayed describing what went wrong and for which input. You can also use the fact that any console output will be shown too. You can write to the console using:

console.log('Debug message');
